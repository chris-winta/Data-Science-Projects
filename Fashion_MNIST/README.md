# [Multiclass classification with Fashion-MNIST]()
  Everybody does MNIST, so let's do Fashion-MNIST! A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on 60,000 greyscale images of fashion articles from 10 categories. The data is provided by Zalando's [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. This deep learning excercise includes:
- **Data preparation:** Loading, exploring, reshaping and normalizing the image data for the deep learning algorithm
- **Model architecture:** Defining the CNN's architecture using Keras
- **Model training:** Training the model on 60,000 fashion article images
- **Model evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance on 10,000 unknown images and tracking the loss and accuracy as a function of epoch number for further insight
- **Visualization:** Applying the trained model to the validation dataset and visualizing its predictions
