- ### [Pokémon EDA](https://github.com/chris-winta/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Pokemon_EDA)
    An exploratory data analysis of the [complete Pokémon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon) comprising type, base stat, and various other information on 802 Pokémon from 7 generations. The EDA includes:
	
        - **Data cleaning:** Reducing the data set to the relevant features and excluding Mega evolutions
        - **Type distributions:** Tracking in visualizing the distributions of Pokémon types throughout the generations
        - **Base stats by type:** Exploring the ability base stats and their dependence on type
        - **Base stats by generation:** Tracking ability base stats through the generations
        - **Base stat correlations** Exploring correlations between base stats, height and weight
        - **(Experimental) Dimensionality reduction**: Simplifying the base stat space using PCA and t-SNE
