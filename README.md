- ### [Pokémon EDA](https://github.com/chris-winta/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Pokemon_EDA)
    An exploratory data analysis of the [complete Pokémon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon) comprising types, base stats, and various other information on 802 Pokémon from 7 generations.

    _Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn_

- ### [Multiclass classification with Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/chris-winta/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Fashion_MNIST)
    Everybody does MNIST, so let's do Fashion-MNIST! A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on 60,000 greyscale images of fashion articles from 10 categories. The data is provided by Zalando's [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.

    _Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras_

- ### [WhatsApp Chat Analysis](https://github.com/chris-winta/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/WhatsApp_Chat_Analysis)
    A text analysis script for WhatsApp chat logs. It extracts statistics and patterns, such as the number of messages sent by each person, average number of words written per hour of day or day of the week as well as the most used words etc. Here, I investigate the messaging behavior between me and my girlfriend over a period of more than two years.
